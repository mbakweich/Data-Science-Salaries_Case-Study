### Project Overview
---

This data analysis project aims to provide insight into the salary prospects of data roles across different countries over the past year. By analysing various aspects of the salary data, we hope to identify trends and gain a deeper understanding of the various opportunities that are available in the field.

### Data Sources

Data Salaries: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the ‚Äúds_salaries.xlsx‚Äù file, containing detailed information about each data science role, country codes and salaries.

Country ISO data codes: The source is an open source from international country codes [Country ISO Code Link](https://www.worlddata.info/countrycodes.php) 

### Tools

- Excel - Data cleaning
  - [Download here](https://microsoft.com)
- PowerBI - Creating report and analysis


### Data Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following task:
1. Using PowerBI, Data set was Extracted, Loaded and Transformed using the Power Quary tool.
2. Data was visually inspected, table renamed, data type asigned using the change type.
3. conditional columns were added to clarify the abbrevations. Afterwards Country ISO codes where Loaded and marged with the salary table using the country codes as the reference to LEFT JOIN.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the salary data to answer key questions such as:

- which Entry Level job title earns the maximum salary in USD?
- Show The trend of the average salary od Data Analyst in the US
- Get the top 3 countries that pay the highest salaries for Entry Level Data Analyst

2. The trend reviews a geometry increase in the salaries of Data Analyst in the US. This is in line with the high demand od data analyst as a result of growing data available.
3. It also reveals the top 3 countries with the hest pay salaries for data analyst to be the US, Austrialia and the United Kingdom

### Recommendations

The continued growth on a tremendous scale of data science in recent years and the competition amongst companies for data science professional to leverage their data and drive smart business decisions in on the rise. As a result, employers are willing to pay top salaries to talented data scientist. 
1. Companies can implement additional incentives and non-work-related activities amongst team members that would not only aim at attracting talented data scientist but will seek to retain them.
